# CatmullClarkTest

This repository is a demo implementation of the Catmull-Clark Subdivision algorithm with Html5 and Three.js r82. It is based on a code from  [wadetb  user](https://github.com/wadetb/subd) that only works in old version of Three.js. Can find the demo [here]( http://foolhardy-bowl.000webhostapp.com). Remember that the Catmull-Clark method works better with quadrilateral meshes. The demo charge a head model by default. 

## Usage of the demo

Import Obj Button: Import .obj file (prefered onbly quad-based)
Export OBj Button: Export like .obj file in quad-based faces.
Subdivide Button: Apply one step of the subdivision Catmull-clark algorithm.
Original Mesh: Go back to the original charged model.
